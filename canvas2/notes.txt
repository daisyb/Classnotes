Why we use requestAnimation frame instead of setInterval

    requestAnimation tells browser to run function before drawing nect frame

    browser attempts to run ~60 frames per second

    lets browser handle when code is executed
    lets browser stop animation when not in foreground

    lets browse handle all the shit you don't want to deal with
